 * Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex.
 * <p>
 * Why
 * <p>
 * Less code takes less time to write, has less bugs, and is easier to modify.
 * Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
 * It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
