/**
 * Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
 * <p>
 * Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code.
 * Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to
 * combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts.
 * <p>
 * Why
 * <p>
 * Duplication (inadvertent or purposeful duplication) can lead to maintenance nightmares, poor factoring, and logical contradictions.
 * A modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.
 * Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.
 * How
 * <p>
 * Put business rules, long expressions, if statements, math formulas, metadata, etc. in only one place.
 * Identify the single, definitive source of every piece of knowledge used in your system, and then use that source
 * to generate applicable instances of that knowledge (code, documentation, tests, etc).
