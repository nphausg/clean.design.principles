/**
 * YAGNI stands for "you aren't gonna need it": don't implement something until it is necessary.
 * <p>
 * Why
 * <p>
 * Any work that's only used for a feature that's needed tomorrow, means losing effort from features that need to be done for the current iteration.
 * It leads to code bloat; the software becomes larger and more complicated.
 * How
 * <p>
 * Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.
 * (Do not implement it until you need it.)
